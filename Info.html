<h2>Frappe Lovers was founded in 2001</h2>

<p>At Frappe Lovers, we take pride in serving you only the most fresh and delicious frappachinos at Frappe Lovers. One of the most popular iced coffee drinks, particularly in Europe and the United States, is the frappe. This drink is made from blended coffee, ice, and milk, and more closely resembles a slush than a traditional cup of coffee.
Frappes are a great way to enjoy your coffee and beat the summer heat. They are cool, sweet, and have a unique texture, which many people enjoy. You can make one at home if you have the ingredients and a blender, and this is one of the only coffee recipes that actually call for instant coffee to make it authentically. Now that you know what a frappe is, you can have one every day from the comfort of your kitchen.</p> 

</p><h2>Ingredients</h2>

  2 cups ice: Crushed ice is best. If you don’t have access to crushed ice, put cubed ice in a Ziplock bag. Use a metal spoon’s back to gently break the ice into smaller pieces. You can also add the cubed ice to a blender.
1 cup espresso or coffee: Whether you get espresso or coffee is up to you. Since additional flavorings are added to the drink, you want the coffee to be strong so that you can taste it at the end.
¾ cup milk: Use your favorite milk variety. This includes half-and-half, condensed milk, cow milk, almond milk, etc.
2 tbsp. sweetener: Select a sweetener. Granulated sugar is the easiest option, but you can select honey, stevia, or another sugar alternative.
Whipped cream (optional): Get a can of whipped cream for the topper.
